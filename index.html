    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Alexander Chen. I'm <code id="age-code-block"></code> years old and am very interested in Computer Science.
        I've been programming for ~<code id="prog-age-code-block"></code> years, mainly in the languages of
        Python, Lisp, Prolog, Java, and JS. (Btw I use Arch :D). I've been studying in a variety of fields including
        algorithms and data structures, application development, and machine learning. 
        Recently, I've started looking deeper into in Computational Linguistics & NLP.

        <br><br>

        I live in Dallas, Texas, and homeschool with the <a href="https://modg.org/">Mother of Divine Grace School</a>.
        I participate in competitive programming, speech and debate, and varsity ice hockey. My Myers-Briggs personality is INTJ,
        and I also have a little sister who plays AAA Ice Hockey on the Dallas Stars Elite 
        (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@minachenhockeyplayer/shorts">Her YouTube Channel</a>).
        In my free time, I enjoy tussling with logic puzzles, playing chess, and learning Latin.

        <h3>8/5/2024 - ALPS Post-Workshop Reflection (Revised 8/13/2024)</h3>
        <p>
            Creating Artificial Intelligence which can think like humans has become a hot topic in recent years.
            Modern engineers have attempted to construct AI using the technique of machine learning: “teaching”
            machines to find patterns in past experiences and use them to generate new results.  But while machine
            learning models like ChatGPT boast impressive capabilities, they lack the fundamental step in the
            actual human thought process: reason.

            <br><br>

            ChatGPT's hallucinations are a humorous defect in the model which demonstrates its lack of reasoning.
            The model only regurgitates text which it has seen before, without knowing if what it produces is right
            or wrong.  This lack of reason proposes a serious concern about the usage of such AI: how can we
            trust machines which don’t understand their own conclusions?

            <br><br>

            However, a different type of AI addresses this problem: “explainable machines”.  This summer, I spent
            two months at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) studying machines which, instead of relying on
            pattern matching, actually utilized logic to derive conclusions.  Instead of just mimicking conclusions
            humans have produced, explainable machines mimic the process of how humans produce logical conclusions.

            <br><br>

            We can equip explainable machines with logical reasoning by formalizing the thought process into
            programmatic “rules”.  We can then tell machines to follow these rules when looking at information
            given to them to derive conclusions.  By following this process, we can see how the machine comes to the
            conclusion that it produces.  In class, we looked at a project attempting to automate Canadian law using
            explainable machines.  Explainable machines could have serious real-world impact in fields where
            transparency is critical in decision-making.

            <br><br>

            To build explainable machines, we used the logic programming language of Prolog.  This language was
            structured perfectly to design explainable machines: programmers, instead of telling the program what
            to do, would define facts and rules, telling the machine how it should reason with information provided.
            The machine would then follow those logical rules to derive a solution for the problem defined by the
            programmer.  Now, the only task for programmers would be to define in rules the problem they were trying
            to solve, and then the machine could solve it for them.  We wrote Prolog code to solve famous puzzles
            including n-queens, tower-of-hanoi, and send+more=money, and I also wrote a Wordle solver.
            Code I wrote can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/AlxV07/UTD_ALPS_2024">https://github.com/AlxV07/UTD_ALPS_2024</a>

            <br><br>

            My experience this summer at UTD was very inspiring.  I enjoyed learning about the Prolog language and how
            to formalize the human thought process in code.  It was especially informative to learn about explainable
            machines and how they could fill the gap in reason of pure machine learning models.  Instead of creating
            artificiality intelligent machines, we could create actually intelligent machines, utilizing logic and
            reason to advance sensible decision-making in the world.

        <h3>5/24/2024 - PreSummer Update</h3>
        <p>
            Just an update post for my upcoming summer plans!  With AP testing done and school finishing up, I'll be moving into
            a pretty busy break.

            <br><br>

            I'll be attending the Applied Logic programming intensive in-person at the University of Texas at Dallas next month,
            and following that I'll also be partaking in InspiritAI online.  I've started back up with my Coursera ed
            and have also started training for the upcoming USACO season.

            <br><br>

            This year's debate season is over, but the resolutions for next year are already out; we'll be preparing for it
            over the summer too.  I'm also going to be taking Latin 1B over the summer in preparation for Latin 2 next school year.
            I also recently broke 1600 rapid rating on chess.com.  We'll be heading to Edmonton in July for the Brick Invitational Hockey Tournament,
            where my sister will be playing for the Western Selects.

            <br><br>

            That's a little bit of what's going on with me for now; I'll probably update this page again later when something interesting happens ;)

        <h3>5/7/2024 - Strong Conclusion to a Strong Year @ Farmers Branch Regional Championship</h3>
        <p>
            Last week I competed in the NCFCA Region 11 Regional Championship tournament, the last of my season.
            Again, it was an amazing experience.  We debated the best of the best this tournament, and it was really fun overall.
            We finished with a record of 3-3 (we never had a losing record this year!), getting close to breaking into Regional elimination rounds.

            <br><br>

            This is my partner's last year in NCFCA, and I want to thank him for everything; literally couldn't have done it without him!

            <br>

        <h3>3/20/2024 - 17/61 @ Ft. Worth National Mixer</h3>
        <p>
            This past week I've been in Ft. Worth competing in the NCFCA National Mixer hosted there this year.
            It was a great experience; my partner and I competed against some of the best teams in our region
            whilst also getting to debate teams from other regions as well.  We advanced to elimination rounds
            again but were eliminated in Double-Octofinals.

            <br><br>

            Even still, it was a great tournament overall - I've developed a lot and have learned a ton since my
            last tournament.  Both my partner and I were awarded 30 speaker points in separate rounds (the maximum
            number of points available) for the first time!  It was such a great experience to debate against
            everyone at Ft. Worth - we really enjoyed it, and we're looking forward to the tournaments in the future!

        <h3>1/30/2024 - I rebranded (5->7)</h3>
        <p>
            Kind of note-worthy news! I changed one character in my username everywhere!
            From "AlxV05" to "AlxV07", links & profiles which could be updated have been updated. Why?
            It goes back to why I have my username in the first place.

            <br><br>

            I first found out I needed my own username ~5 years ago (10 yrs old) while making
            some random account I don't have access to anymore. I came up with
            "Alx" quick enough, decided I liked version numbers so added the "V0" soon after,
            and finally I just had to choose the last character. 5 sounded cool ("al-ks-vee-oh-five").
            Nothing special about 5; just sounded cool.

            <br><br>

            Well I'm mature now ;) and I'd prefer to have my markers have more meaning than just
            it "sounding cool".  So I looked at my username: Alx still fits; three-char compact
            name-like tags are always nice to have around. Second part: the version identifier - I
            think I'll keep it, I'm getting updated :D So that means I need to choose a number greater
            than 5. 7's the only single-digit number greater than 0 that has two syllables (unique).
            I'm also Catholic, and the number 7 symbolises some significant topics: perfection, the
            7 days of creation, the 7 cardinal virtues, and many more references from the Bible.

            <br><br>

            After updating everything it feels kinda nice. It's always good to have a switch-up
            every now and then (as long as it isn't too drastic nor does it cause any problems).
            Well, I guess till next time. Bye!

        <h3>1/29/2024 - First Blog Post :D</h3>
        <p>
            Hello! This is my first blog post (Yay!) What does one do with a blog?
            I'm not entirely sure, but I think I'm supposed to post about things that
            have been happening. So here are some normal things I've been up to recently:
        <ul>
            <li>Training on USACO Silver division problems</li>
            <li>Started Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Coursera course w/ DeepLearning.AI & Stanford Online</li>
            <li>Had some fun with robotics friends developing their scouting application</li>
            <li>Programmed a full-functional String Trie for my UCSD String Algorithms course I'm taking</li>
        </ul>
            I think another purpose of having a blog is so that one can share whatever one feels like
            sharing at a moments notice with whoever would care to read that one person's blog. I think
            every now and then people have that sort of inspiration, but I have yet to experience that.
            <br><br>
            Ah well, if anything interesting happens I might update this page with a post for that
            (I also usually post note-worthy events on my LinkedIn page, so if this page doesn't change for a
            while I might have just forgotten to post here as well (but if there isn't anything
            new on my LinkedIn then I'm probably just not doing anything note-worthy ;-;)).
            <br><br>
            But that's it for now, bye!
