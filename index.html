    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Alexander Chen: I am <code id="age-code-block"></code> years old, and am very interested in Computer Science.
        I've been programming for ~<code id="prog-age-code-block"></code> years, developing my skills mainly in
        Java, Python, Lisp, & JavaScript. I've been training myself in fields ranging from algorithms and data structures to software development to machine learning,
        using online college Coursera courses and other educational websites. Btw I use Arch ;)

        <br><br>

        I live in Dallas, Texas, and homeschool with the <a href="https://modg.org/">Mother of Divine Grace School</a>.
        I play varsity ice hockey, compete in speech and debate, and also participate in competitive programming.

    </p>

            I decided to write my own simple Lisp interpreter to aid my study: <a href="https://github.com/AlxV05/PyLispSICP/tree/main">PyLisp</a>.</li>
        <li>I took my first ever AP test (APCSA) in 8th grade and scored a 5.</li>
        <li>I created the ActionAutomator in 2023, a Java application which enables the user to create keyboard-shortcuts for mouse and keyboard automation anywhere onscreen.

        <h3>1/29/2024 - First Blog Post :D</h3>
        <p>
            Hello! This is my first blog post (Yay!) What does one do with a blog?
            I'm not entirely sure, but I think I'm supposed to post about things that
            have been happening. So here are some normal things I've been up to recently:
        <ul>
            <li>Training on USACO Silver division problems</li>
            <li>Started Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Coursera course w/ DeepLearning.AI & Stanford Online</li>
            <li>Had some fun with robotics friends developing their scouting application</li>
            <li>Programmed a full-functional String Trie for my UCSD String Algorithms course I'm taking</li>
        </ul>
            I think another purpose of having a blog is so that one can share whatever one feels like
            sharing at a moments notice with whoever would care to read that one person's blog. I think
            every now and then people have that sort of inspiration, but I have yet to experience that.
            <br><br>
            Ah well, if anything interesting happens I might update this page with a post for that
            (I also usually post note-worthy events on my LinkedIn page, so if this page doesn't change for a
            while I might have just forgotten to post here as well (but if there isn't anything
            new on my LinkedIn then I'm probably just not doing anything note-worthy ;-;)).
            <br><br>
            But that's it for now, bye!
